                    The project for Vela was part of a boot camp assignment. My task was to develop a solution to
                    simplify and streamline weather reports for water sports. I was responsible for conducting surveys
                    and interviews, researching, creating personas; user flows, a sitemap, wireframes, the prototype,
                    and conducting testing.

            <div>
                <p>
                    The challenge I faced was addressing user frustration with the overly complex and confusing weather
                    reports provided by companies. The information was not user-friendly, making it difficult for
                    non-experts to understand and access the insights they needed. The goal is to decrease the time
                    users spend analyzing reports with the analyzer tool by 30%. This will be tracked over a 3-month
                    period, monitoring repetitive usage patterns and comparing the results to the average analysis time
                    on other platforms.

                        ​I want to highlight the evolution of Vela from a low-fidelity to a high-fidelity "final"
                        product. The first three images show a progression from low to high fidelity. However, I decided
                        to give Vela another makeover because I wasn't satisfied with the design. This is why the
                        structure is different in the high-fidelity "final" prototype. Highlighted features include,
                        home, community, analyzer, events, and event details.

                        For testing, I had 6 participants; I gave each of them 2 scenarios and 2 tasks to complete which
                        are listed below. Afterwards, I organized on the information on a rainbow spreadsheet and giving
                        each issue a rating on what needed to be fixed.

                        I decided to give Vela a makeover because I wasn't satisfied with the first design. It felt
                        blank and very cookie cutter and didn't seem to portray the aesthetic feeling I wanted. The
                        makeover included: restructuring, change of colors, and updates using the feedback from testing.
                        When sharing the updated design with participant's, the feedback was positive!

                        Working on Vela has been an amazing experience that combines my passion for design with my love
                        for adventure and user empowerment. Vela's goal is to make outdoor activities more accessible,
                        safe, and enjoyable for everyone, from beginners to experts. Throughout the design process, I
                        focused on balancing user needs with practical business goals, ensuring that Vela not only
                        provides valuable information but also fosters strong user engagement. As I continue to refine
                        Vela and look toward future projects, my goal remains to design solutions that ignite
                        creativity, promote adventure, and make life's experiences more memorable. Thank you for joining
                        me on this journey!
